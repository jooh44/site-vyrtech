## Document Inventory

### PRD Documents Files Found

**Whole Documents:**

- [prd.md](file:///home/johny/Documentos/projetos/vyrtech/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md) (12589 bytes, 2026-02-26 23:29:30)

### Architecture Documents Files Found

**Whole Documents:**

- [architecture.md](file:///home/johny/Documentos/projetos/vyrtech/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md) (1486 bytes, 2026-02-26 23:34:49)

### Epics & Stories Documents Files Found

⚠️ **WARNING:** Required document not found

- Epics and Stories document not found. This is a critical gap before implementation can start, but aligned with the current phase of preparing for epic creation.

### UX Design Documents Files Found

**Whole Documents:**

- [ux-design-specification.md](file:///home/johny/Documentos/projetos/vyrtech/_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification.md) (11638 bytes, 2026-02-26 23:51:46)

## Issues Found

- **Missing Epics & Stories:** As noted by the user, this is the next step. The readiness check will focus on whether the PRD, Architecture, and UX provide sufficient detail to create these epics.
- **Outdated Report:** An existing report dated 2026-02-27 mistakenly listed Architecture and UX as missing. This new report corrects that inventory.
